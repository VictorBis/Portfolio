                        <h4>Name</h4>
                        <p>The enterprise was born in a town called Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, Oaxaca, where people speak <i>Zapoteco</i>. So I proposed to name the brand with a word in this language.
                           <br> <br> The pronunciation and writing of some words are very difficult for non-speakers, but in the end, we found the word that matches what we were looking for.
                           <br> <br> <strong>Yaj ban</strong> means <i>'Living flower'</i>. The flower is a very representative element of the Yalalg's culture, and it's used to create clothes, the most important component of a dress.

                        <p>I presented logos with threads, sewing machines, needles, and some elements used in the fabrication of a dress, but we decided to match the name with the logo. 
                            The best way to do it was using the <strong>Huipil Yalalteco</strong>, the traditional dress of Yalalg.

                            get a dress, so I decided to place it in the first section. In the interviews I realized that some
                            users want to know that the people they're dealing with are reliable, that's why I decided to create two sections,
                            one dedicated to showing who we are, displaying the photo of the seamstress, and demonstrating all the expertise we have in the industry,
                            and the second one, which shows testimonials of people who have worked with us.

                        <h4>Products List</h4>
                        <p>I maintained the product list similar to a lot of e-commerce websites and displaying the most important information.
                            I wanted to facilitate the way users can find the dress they're looking for, so I added a search box in the navigation bar and
                            placed a dropdown that lets them sort the products by name or price.

                        <h4>Single Product</h4>
                        <p>On the single product page, I only colocated the information people wanted. Name, price, a brief description that includes the materials,
                            colors available at the moment, sizes and its size chart, and the options to buy now or book an appointment. It was important
                            to show that we have more options than the ones displayed, but they may not be available at the moment, that's why I placed the contact us option 
                            at the bottom of the section.

                        <p>The buy now, book an appointment, and contact us page are very similar. It was hard to maintain all the process inside the website
                            due to different factors, but it allowed me to create a really short and easy form. In order to avoid confusion, I wrote a 
                            brief description that indicates what the users need to do and that we are going to contact them once we receive the message.

                    <p>I wanted to do the first test with the wireframes, but it's been hard to find people who are willing to do live testing and some of them didn't understand it at all.

                        <li><strong>Why the user can’t buy inside the website?</strong> <br> 
                            The main reason is that we can’t calculate the shipping rate automatically, it depends on many factors, so we can’t show an exact final price. Displaying only the price of the dress and letting users pay it without knowing the shipping rate would cause a lot of problems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why the user can’t book an appointment inside the website?</strong> <br>
                            The store might be far away from the user’s house, so we give them the option to meet us at an intermediate point. Defining this point may take several messages that can’t be hosted on the website, so we decided to make all this process in an app that is more comfortable for the user and seller.</li>

                    <p>With this project, I learned to do things I thought I wouldn't do but helped me to acquire new skills.</p>

                        <li>Finding users to interview was really hard, and it got more complicated because the main market in Mexico City to find
                            potential users is closed due to COVID-19. I sent messages to more than 30 Instagram and Facebook accounts and only 12 answered me. When 
                            the firsts answers were coming, I realized that I had to add and be more specific in the questions I was asking in the survey,
                            fortunately, an online survey is really easy to update. <br> <br>
                            I had the chance to do some 1:1 interviews and I realized that is so much different than doing online surveys.
                        </li>
                        <li>The enterprise didn't have any photos of the dresses, so I had to take and edit all of them.</li>
                        <li>Defining a name for an enterprise that matches with the values and work an enterprise does is really hard, also 
                            a lot of domain names are already taken, which makes it even more complicated. Luckily the enterprise had 
                            unique roots that facilitated this process so much.
                        </li>
                        <li>Before doing this project I built some school projects, but I've never considered interviewing users
                            to understand their necessities. I had an idea of how the website was going to look like, but a lot of
                            things I had in mind wasn't exactly what the users wanted.
