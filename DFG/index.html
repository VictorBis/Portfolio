                            Our initial plan included usability testing of the final design, but delays prevented us from completing it. 
                            We should have incorporated testing earlier or reduced time on some tasks to allow time for testing, get valuable feedback 
                            from users and make&nbsp;adjustments.

                        <li>Working closely with the DFG executive team was a valuable experience. I learned that design must align 
                            with client needs as well as user needs and that it's important to choose your battles&nbsp;wisely.
