                        <br><br>

                    <h3 class="summary">The main problem is on the development side, but it still has problems that can be solved before&nbsp;implementation</h3>
                    <p>With the analysis I did at the beginning, the interviews, reviews, and the usability test, I confirmed that the app has a lot of problems that can be solved only with code, and it's
                        the main reason why the app isn't&nbsp;used.
                        <br><br>
                        I found some pain points:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li><strong>Can't explore the cinemas out of your&nbsp;town.</strong>
                            <br>
                            Users want to explore the schedule of cinemas that are outside their town, but they can't do&nbsp;it.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The process of buying a ticket is&nbsp;large.</strong>
                            <br>
                            Users didn't like to introduce all their data in the process because they've already introduced it when they logged in and felt that
                            the process is needlessly&nbsp;large.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The button "Siguiente" isn't&nbsp;visible.</strong>
                            <br>
                            In the process of buying a ticket, some users didn't notice the next&nbsp;button.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Selecting the seats is&nbsp;confusing.</strong>
                            <br>
                            When you go to the cinema they always indicate you where is the screen, surprisingly this is really necessary, as some users that helped me with the test didn't notice&nbsp;it.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>After you buy a ticket, there's no&nbsp;confirmation.</strong>
                            <br>
                            I found two comments in the App Store that mentioned that when you finish your purchase, the app doesn't show you a&nbsp;confirmation.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Can't add or update a credit&nbsp;card.</strong>
                            <br>
                            Users couldn't add or update a credit card as they can do it in other apps unless they do it in the process of buying a ticket. This form was complicated for two
                            people that participated in my&nbsp;test.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Have to explore all the catalog to find a&nbsp;movie.</strong>
                            <br>
                            The only way of finding a movie is by scrolling through all the&nbsp;content.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>They ask you for a PIN to see your club&nbsp;information.</strong>
                            <br>
                            In order to see how many points, visits, and all your club information, you need a PIN that some people don't&nbsp;know.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The app loads slowly and sometimes&nbsp;freeze.</strong>
                            <br>
                            When you open the app, sometimes it takes so much time to load all the content, it's common that it freezes and you can't do&nbsp;anything.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>The home section didn't present many problems, people could navigate through it without problems. I changed the position of the list icon, as people didn't notice it in the
                                test I did. The main change is the search icon, a feature that lets people find a movie&nbsp;faster.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The tab bar now has only two options because the <i>cinema</i> it's already in the home section and there's no necessity to put it&nbsp;there.

                                Selecting a cinema was a problem for the people because they couldn't see the schedule of movies out of their town. I changed the way people can select the cinemas, allowing them to explore every cinema

                                the chance to explore the main information about the movie they're looking&nbsp;for.

                            <p>The summary was on the seat section, as I changed it, I decided to make this a single section at the end of the process, giving people all the information they introduced

                    <p>I did a final test with two people, these people helped a lot by commenting everything they were thinking, and, in order to keep a record of their thoughts, I decided to
                        create a Feedback Capture Grid to maintain all this information&nbsp;organized. <br>
                        <br>
                        Overall, the results obtained in the redesign were better than the ones in the first test (with the original design), but I still have to make some improvements, as the
                        app has some things that should be&nbsp;changed.

                        <li>The app has things that at the beginning I wanted to change, but it turned out that people didn't have problems with&nbsp;them.
                        </li>
                        <li>Code is really important, the main problem of the app is in this part, so design and development need to work well. If one doesn't work, it
                            doesn't matter how well the other is done, people won't use&nbsp;it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cinépolis has its design system, so I had to search the colors and everything they use and try to maintain as much as possible with what I&nbsp;had.
