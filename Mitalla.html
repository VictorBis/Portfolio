                    <p>COVID-19 changed the way we used to do a lot of things, buying clothes is one of them. Physical stores had to close for so long and
                        people had to buy clothes online, something that some of them had never done. Unfortunately, some people had a bad experience buying something
                        that didn't fit them, even though they've bought in the store before or used the size chart to select the right one. <br><br>
                        Sizes vary on different clothes despite they are from the same store, maybe it's because its materials or its manufacture, but there's something that makes them different.

                            Size charts are different in every store, so they need to measure their body each time. This app needs to speed up the process of buying
                            an item in order to not hinder it.

                            There must be a way to find the item you want to buy and the size that fits you inside the app.

                        <li><strong>Testimonials.</strong>
                            Some people I interviewed don't trust size charts anymore, and decided not to buy clothes until the physical stores open. It can be solved by doing right
                            recommendations and letting people know what other users experienced. 
                        </li>

                            Measuring your body could be a little confusing for some people, they're not really sure if they're doing it right, and some websites
                            don't have images to make this process easier.

                            Enterprises get new employees and loses some constantly, with the structure we have there's no way to deny the access to an employee that doesn't work

                            is amazing.
