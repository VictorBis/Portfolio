                    <p>At first, we were hesitant about the product. The assessment was lengthy, asking questions 
                        about users' lives and habits, leading us to assume that people wouldn't complete it. <br><br>
                        A survey with 200 participants had already been conducted, and after reviewing the results, we 
                        found that despite the nature of the questionnaire, users were likely to complete it if 
                        it provided personalized&nbsp;content.

                    </h3>
                    <p>The plan was to integrate each section sequentially into a draft. However, early on, I noticed issues with some 
                        questions and the structure. If we continued with the original plan, similar problems would likely arise as we progressed, leading to repeated discussions 
                        with stakeholders and revisiting approved mockups, ultimately wasting&nbsp;time. <br><br>
                        Building on <i>Forms that Work</i> by C. Jarrett and G. Gaffney, I proposed a new approach to the team, outlining a plan based on four key pillars and 
                        clearly explaining the goals and tasks for each&nbsp;stage.

                            With the second version, we planned another round of testing to confirm the effectiveness of our changes. When the project resumes, this will be the first step.

                            At the beginning we ideated ways to encourage the completition of the assessment outside of it, but as the request was only on
                            the assessment, we left those ideas for a future state.

                        <li>
                            We aimed to specify the reasons for each private question to enhance transparency, build trust, and increase completion rates. If we had more supporting data and resources, this would be a valuable improvement to&nbsp;consider.

                            Without a clear strategy, the project would have been chaotic, with wasted time revisiting earlier stages due to issues found&nbsp;later.

                        <li>Documenting agreements is helpful for reviewing the reasons behind decisions if needed later.

                            helps them understand the reasoning, reconsider their opinions if necessary, and provide valuable insights for&nbsp;improvement.
