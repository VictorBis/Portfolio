                    <p>The Wellbeing Assessment covers Mind, Body, Wallet, and Life, personalizing the platform based on responses to offer 
                        tailored content, recommendations, and action items for better work-life balance over&nbsp;time.

                    <p>Gathering all this data is crucial for the algorithm to deliver a more personalized and engaging experience, which enhances user satisfaction, 
                        and potentially attracts new clients. However, given the nature of the questions, it's likely that a significant percentage of users might not complete the&nbsp;assessment.

                        willing to complete it, and we felt confident that it would have successfully met business&nbsp;expectations.<br><br>
                        The design process for this project had a significant positive impact on the design department, leading to its

                    </h3>
                    <p>Since the assessment content was already defined by the business, the plan was to integrate each section sequentially into a draft. However, early on, I identified issues with some 
                        questions and the overall structure. If we continued with the original plan, similar problems would likely arise as we progressed, leading to repeated discussions 
                        with stakeholders and revisiting approved mockups, ultimately wasting&nbsp;time. <br><br>
                        Building on <i>Forms that Work</i> by C. Jarrett and G. Gaffney, I proposed a new approach to the team, outlining a plan based on four key pillars and 
                        clearly explaining the goals and tasks for each&nbsp;stage.
