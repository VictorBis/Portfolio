                            <p class="left-aligned">To save space, I replaced quick link cards with horizontal chips and conducted usability testing on this&nbsp;approach. <br><br>
                                The first round of testing was generally positive, but about 35% of users didn’t notice they could scroll when the chips fit perfectly on the screen. 
                                This challenge was complex due to the variability in chip length and device screen&nbsp;size.<br><br>
                                I explored multiple solutions, and decided to address this by adding an animation during loading to visually cue users that the section was scrollable. 
                                The second round of testing showed a reduction in users who missed the horizontal scroll&nbsp;feature.

                    <p>Accessibility became a core value of AWLDS. Fortunately, there were already efforts in place to identify and resolve accessibility&nbsp;issues. <br><br>
                        These efforts focused on two main areas: the level access list and dynamic&nbsp;typography.</p>

                                <p class="left-aligned">The experts gave us a list of violations and recommendations. 
                                    I prioritized these issues by severity and addressed them with our a11y team. 
                                    Some were already fixed, while others needed more&nbsp;effort. <br><br>
                                    One complex issue was the 401(k) graph, which lacked alt text. Given the difficulty of 
                                    conveying all chart data through alt text, I added a table view that describes the 
                                    information, making it accessible to screen&nbsp;readers.

                    <p>Many app screens shared similar layouts but with different content. By providing the dev team with key templates, they could migrate the entire 
                        app without needing mockups for every screen available. For screens that didn't fit a template, the design team created&nbsp;them. <br><br>
                        Some key flows were going to be updated using the new design language before and after the app's update launch. To ensure consistency, I created design 
                        guidelines for AWLDS focused on the app, and I reviewed and approved new designs to ensure they aligned with the app's&nbsp;standards.
