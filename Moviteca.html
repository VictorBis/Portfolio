                    <p>Moviteca is one of the projects of the <i>Laboratorio Experimental de Artes y Aplicaciones A.C.</i>, which
                    is an association that wants to encourage reading and acquiring culture in the public, private and educational sectors
                    through different programs. <br><br>
                    Moviteca is only in social networks, and they actually have a base of followers, but they want to expand
                    their product to impact more people.

                    </h3>
                    <p>In average, mexicans read 3.4 books per year. People don't tend to read and every year the number of readers decreases. Moviteca
                        attacks the problem by creating content about reading and culture, involving recommendations, tips, articles, interviews, reports,
                        images, videos and more, which they share on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. <br> <br>
                        Their followers ask them to give them an option that allows them to read all this content in a different platform,
                        because they sometimes miss it and it's not the most comfortable way to consume its content.

                        <p>Enterprises are the ones that keep alive this project, so they receive exclusive content depending on the goals they have. The login form just asks
                            for the code we give the employees of the enterprises that work with us. If someone forgets the code, there's no way to get it inside the app due to
                            we don't have the tools to automatize it at the moment.
                            <br><br>
                            Enterprises get new employees and loses some constantly, with the structure we have there's no way to deny the access to an employee that doesn't work
                            for an enterprise anymore, that's why I decided to change the code every month, so we can keep restrung the access.

                        <p>The main content of the app are articles. A lot of our publications in social networks are shared, that's why I decided to add this option inside the app. In order to
                            give the article more space, I decided to remove the tab bar when the users scroll down, and it'll appears
                            when they scroll up. <br><br>
                            We received comments of some people who told us that a problem they had is that when they're reading a large article,
                            they sometimes forget the title or the main subject, that's why I decided to always show what the user is reading.
