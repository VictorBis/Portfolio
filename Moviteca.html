                    <h3 class="summary">A project that wants to encourage reading and culture in Mexico</h3>
                    <p>Moviteca is one of the projects of the <i>Laboratorio Experimental de Artes y Aplicaciones A.C.</i>, which
                    is an association that wants to encourage reading and culture in the public, private and educational sectors
                    through different programs. <br><br>
                    Moviteca is only in social networks and they actually have a base of followers, but they want to expand
                    their product to impact more people.

                    <h2 class="subtitle">The Problem</h2>
                    <h3 class="summary">Moviteca has a huge catalog of content, but the only way they have
                        to share it is via social networks
                    </h3>
                    <p>In average, mexicans read 3.4 books per year. People don't tend to read and every year the number of readers decreases. Moviteca
                        attacks the problem by creating content about reading and culture, involving recomendations, tips, articles, interviews, reports,
                        images, videos and more, which they share on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. <br> <br>
                        Their followers asks them to give them an option that allows them to read all this content in a different plataform,
                        because they sometimes misses it and it's not the most comfortable way to consume its content.

                    <h3 class="summary">A website and an app that lets people explore all the content that Moviteca offers</h3>
                    <p>The website and the app will allow the users to explore the content in a more comfortable way,
                        giving them a clearer organization, easier navigation and better ways to consume the content
                        than social networks provides. <br><br>
                        Moviteca is funded by the services that it provides to different companies and the app will display exclusive
                        content for their workers. This is a feature that will allows them to get more clients,
                        subsist and mantain most of it's content for free.

                    <p>It was hard to find apps with similar goals and information, most of them were only to buy books. In the end, I 
                        did the analysis with apps from government, schools and editorials, which are direct competitors. Almost all of them have apps that has an
                        interface that looks old or with features that doesn't work, but I found some important information that will
                        help me to build a better product.

                    <div class="design-image-container">
                        <h4>Name</h4>
                        <p>The enterprise was born in a town called Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, Oaxaca, where people speak <i>Zapoteco</i>. So I proposed to name the brand with a word in this language.
                           <br> <br> The pronunciation and writing of some words are very difficult for non speakers, but in the end we found the word that matches what we were looking for.
                           <br> <br> <strong>Yaj ban</strong> means <i>'Living flower'</i>. The flower is a very representative element of the Yalalg's culture, and it's used to create cloths, the most important component of a dress.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="design-image-container last-item">
                        <h4>Logo</h4>
                        <p>I presented logos with threads, sewing machines, neddles and some elements used in the fabrication of a dress, but we decided to match the name with the logo. 
                            The best way to do it was using the <strong>Huipil Yalalteco</strong>, the traditional dress of Yalalg.

                        <h4>Home</h4>
                        <p>I kept the home page clean, only showing the essential. I wanted to demonstrate how easy is to
                            get a dress, so I decided to place it in the first section. In the interviews I realized that some
                            users want to know that the people they're dealing with are reliable, that's why I decided to create two sections,
                            one dedicated to show who we are, displaying the photo of the seamstress and demonstrating all the expertise we have in the industry,
                            and the second one, which shows testimonials of people who has worked with us.

                        <p>I maintained the product list similar to a lot of e-commerce websites and displaying the most important information.
                            I wanted to facilitate the way users can find the dress they're looking for, so I added a search box in the navigation bar and
                            placed a dropdown that lets them sort the products by name or price.

                        <p>In the single product page I only colocated the information people wanted. Name, price, a brief description that includes the materials,
                            colors available at the moment, sizes and its size chart, and the options to buy now or book an appointment. It was important
                            to show that we have more options that the ones displayed, but they may not be avaliabale at the moment, that's why I placed a contact us option 
                            at the bottom of the section.

                        <p>The buy now, book an appointment and contact us page are very similar. It was hard to mantain all the process inside the website
                            due to different factors, but it allowed me to create a really short and easy form. In order to avoid confusion, I wrote a 
                            brief description that indicates what the users need to do and that we are going to contact them once we receive the message.

                        <li><strong>Why the user can’t buy inside the website?</strong> <br> 
                            The main reason is that we can’t calculate the shipping rate automatically, it depends on many factors, so we can’t show an exactly final price. Displaying only the price of the dress and letting users pay it without knowing the shipping rate would cause a lot of problems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why the user can’t book an appointment inside the website?</strong> <br>
                            The store might be far away from the user’s house, so we give them the option to meet us in an intermediate point. Defining this point may take sveral messages that can’t be host in the website, so we decided to make all this process in an app that is more comfortable for the user and seller.</li>

                    <p>With this project I learned to do things I though I wouldn't do, but helped me to acquire new skills.</p>
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li>Finding users to interview was really hard, and it got more complicated because the main market in Mexico City to find
                            potential users is closed due to COVID-19. I sent messages to more than 30 Instagram and Facebook accounts and only 12 answered me. When 
                            the firsts answers were comming, I realized that I had to add and be more specific in the questions I was asking in the survey,
                            fortunatley, an online survey is realy easy to update. <br> <br>
                            I had the chance to do some 1:1 interviews and I realized that is so much different than doing online surveys.
                        </li>
                        <li>The enterprise didn't have any photo of the dresses, so I had to take and edit all of them.</li>
                        <li>Defining a name for an enterpise that matches with the values and work an enterprise does is really hard, also 
                            a lot of domain names are already taken, which makes it even more complicated. Luckily the enterprise had 
                            unique roots that facilitated this process so much.
                        </li>
                        <li>Before doing this project I built some school projects, but I've never considered interviewing users
                            to understan their necessities. I had an idea of how the website was going to look like, but a lot of
                            things I had in mind wasn't exactly what the users wanted.
