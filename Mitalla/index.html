                                and comparing the results with your&nbsp;measures.

                                The form is divided into three steps, the first one is to know general information about the item, the second one is to know the real measures of the size, and the last one to know the
                                experience users&nbsp;had.

                    <p>Once I finished the final design and the prototype, I did a final test with 3 people. I tested the main actions in the app and realize that even though
                        the results were pretty good, the app needed some improvements, for instance, the forms were too long and some people only filled the obligatory&nbsp;fields.
