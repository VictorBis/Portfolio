                            There must be a way to find the item you want to buy and the size that fits you inside the app.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Testimonials.</strong>
                            Some people I interviewed don't trust size charts anymore and decided not to buy clothes until the physical stores open. It can be solved by doing the right
                            recommendations and letting people know what other users experienced. 
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Help in app.</strong>
                            Measuring your body could be a little confusing for some people, they're not really sure if they're doing it right, and some websites
                            don't have images to make this process easier.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Redirect to stores.</strong>
                            To continue the flow of buying clothes and not hindering it, redirecting to the websites can keep the process fluent.

                            Searching by photo is a feature I've seen in other apps, and I think it can improve the way of finding an item in the app, as it reduces as much as possible the time of searching an item.

                        <p>This is the section that accomplishes the main goal of the app. The recommendation is based on the information users provide about the item, it's obtained by calculating the average of all the measures users provided about each size
                            and comparing the results with the measures of the user.
                            <br>

                            Based on the information the app has about each item, it displays recommendations of stores where users can buy what they're looking for, displaying at the top the best price. This is added because it helps people in the process of 
                            buying an item, but also because stores can realize the traffic that is generated from the app to its website, and fund the app in some way.

                    <p>Once I finished the final design and the prototype, I did a final test with 3 people. I tested the main actions in the app and realize that even though
                        the results were pretty good, the app needed some improvements, for instance, the forms were too long and some people only filled the obligatory fields.

                        <li><strong>Testing early is awesome.</strong> I had the chance to do a test with the wireframes, and it made me realize some things that
                            could be solved before the next test, and avoid these problems again.
