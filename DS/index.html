                        To address this, the design system team streamlined the process with a comprehensive design&nbsp;system.

                    <p>The web design system has seen significant progress and is where most of the effort has been concentrated. 
                        When the app migrated to AWLDS, it used the initial version of the system. Since then, many improvements have

                            Fortunately, the foundations such as brand, tone, voice, formatting, colors, icons, grid, and typography were already 
                            established and documented in AWLDS web. We leveraged these assets for the app, making necessary adjustments where&nbsp;applicable.

                            A few designers and I defined design tokens primarily for web components. Although we couldn't use all of that work on the 
                            web at the time, we adapted it to include app tokens. We then synchronized these tokens from Figma to&nbsp;code, 
                            enabling their use in app component development.

                            We fully integrated basic components like buttons, toggles, and navigation into the design system. 
                            Components in Figma utilized tokens and naming conventions defined, and were tested to ensure its correct functionality. Documentation was created, 
                            incorporating all sections needed and accessibility guidelines. 
                            Finally, components were implemented in code, ensuring accessibility and consistency between Figma and the&nbsp;implementation.

                            As the design system team grew, inconsistent practices emerged due to varying interpretations of the practices. 
                            To address this, I defined and documented clear standards, created templates where needed, and made them accessible 
                            to ensure consistency and minimize future&nbsp;issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ongoing feedback and timely action are essential for creating a great product and ensuring user&nbsp;satisfaction. 
                            The initial version of the app remained unchanged for too long, resulting in unresolved issues that could have 
                            been addressed sooner to prevent bigger&nbsp;problems.

                            Demonstrating value through actions and results, rather than just words, significantly increases the chances of achieving a&nbsp;goal.
