                        To address this, the design system team streamlined the process with a comprehensive design&nbsp;system.

                    <p>The web design system has seen significant progress and is where most of the effort has been concentrated. 
                        When the app migrated to AWLDS, it used the initial version of the system. Since then, many improvements have

                        Six designers were interviewed, grouped by their familiarity with the Mobile App Library: slightly, moderately, and highly familiar.
