                        To address this, the design system team streamlined the process with a comprehensive design&nbsp;system.

                    <p>The web design system has seen significant progress and is where most of the effort has been concentrated. 
                        When the app migrated to AWLDS, it used the initial version of the system. Since then, many improvements have 
                        been made, but the app has not been updated to reflect these&nbsp;changes.

                        To align the app with the latest AWLDS standards and ensure a consistent cross-platform experience, we conducted

                    <p>
                        Six designers were interviewed, divided into three groups: slightly, moderately, and highly familiar with the 
                        Mobile App Library. The goal was to understand their needs, preferences, challenges with the current library, 
                        and gather specific insights on file structure, component organization, and guideline clarity. The key findings&nbsp;were:

                        <li>

                        <li>
                            Shared components like buttons and checkboxes were hard to distinguish between web and&nbsp;app.

                        <li>
                            Consolidating all references in one place was crucial for easily accessing app flows and finding&nbsp;inspiration.

                    </ul> <br>
                    <p>Although the web design system wasn't the main focus of the research, designers offered valuable feedback that we could use. Key points&nbsp;included:

                    <ul class="bullet-list bullet-after-text">

                            <p class="left-aligned">To save space, we replaced quick link cards with horizontal chips and conducted usability testing on this&nbsp;approach. <br><br>
                                The first round of testing was generally positive, but about 35% of users didn’t notice they could scroll when the chips fit perfectly on the screen. 
                                This challenge was complex due to the variability in chip length and device screen&nbsp;size.<br><br>
                                We addressed this by adding an animation during loading to visually cue users that the section was scrollable. 
                                The second round of testing showed a reduction in users who missed the horizontal scroll&nbsp;feature.

                    <p>Accessibility became a core value of AWLDS. Fortunately, there were already efforts in place to identify and resolve accessibility&nbsp;issues. <br><br>
                        These efforts focused on two main areas: the level access list and dynamic&nbsp;typography.</p>

                                    Some were already fixed, while others needed more&nbsp;effort. <br><br>
                                    One complex issue was the 401(k) graph, which lacked alt text. Given the difficulty of 
                                    conveying all chart data through alt text, we added a table view that describes the

                    <p>Many app screens shared similar layouts but with different content. By providing the dev team with key templates, they could migrate the entire

                        Some key flows were going to be updated using the new design language before and after the app's update launch. To ensure consistency, we created design 
                        guidelines for AWLDS focused on the app, and I reviewed and approved new designs to ensure they aligned with the app's&nbsp;standards.
